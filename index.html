					<h1>Appearance</h1>
					<hr />
					<p>
						She is a beautiful well-endowed young woman who has blue eyes and short blonde hair that
						is white on top of her head.
					</p>
					<p>
						As the 6th Unit Chief, she is often dressed in her Anti-Demon Corps uniform, consisting
						of a navy blue militia tunic, a cap with red highlights, white gloves, shorts, and
						thigh-high boots. She has worn two different sets of earrings, a single earring with a
						feather on her right ear and blue pendant earrings.
					</p>
					<p>Tenka is often seen wearing civilian clothes when she isn't in service.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="personality">
					<h1>Personality</h1>
					<hr />
					<p>
						Tenka is a calm, mature, and good-natured woman, which was noted from her interactions
						around the 7th Unit, rarely showing anything but a lighthearted and genuine demeanor.
						Dissimilar from Yachiho, she is confident in her abilities and her unit, but not
						overconfident and never looks down on others like the latter. It is noted that Tenka
						refers to others affectionately, such as calling Kyouka "Kyou-chin" and Yuuki at first
						"Slave-kun".
					</p>
					<p>
						Similar to Kyouka, the members of her unit look up to Tenka, and she, in turn, cares
						about them. She does not mind if any of them lose a battle, taking it as a lesson for
						them, giving them all advice after a loss. She will gladly jump in to save her
						subordinates' lives from an opponent.
					</p>
					<p>
						She developed an initial interest in Yuuki, not looking down on him for being a man or
						slave. These feelings progressed as she witnessed him fighting and helping others,
						causing her to develop strong feelings for him. She is very brash and straightforward
						with her interest with him, attempting to seduce him after only meeting him recently.
						She often flirts with him alone or in front of others, even asking Kyouka if she could
						have Yuuki. In fact, though Tenka hadn't shown anger before, she hated the fact that
						Yuuki was kidnapped by the humanoid Shuuki led by his older sister. Her feelings were
						such that she couldn't bring herself to hurt Aoba since she knew how much she meant to
						Yuuki, instead taking a hit head-on. She is also not one to hold grudges, as her
						interactions with Aoba following their fight are shown to be amicable, even somewhat
						sisterly.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="background">
					<h1>Background</h1>
					<hr />
					<p>
						Tenka has been an honor student from childhood, never failing in anything. She was never
						interested in boys her age, and lived life in boredom whenever alone, even after
						becoming a member of the Anti-Demon Corps.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="powers-and-abilities">
					<h1>Powers and Abilities</h1>
					<hr />
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>
						Like all other women, Tenka attained a unique power having devoured one of the peaches
						from Mato. As one of the Anti-Demon Corps' Chiefs, she is much more powerful than normal
						Demon Hunters and as such is one of the strongest women in the organization. Befitting
						the 6th Unit Chief, Tenka has the highest authority among the 6th Unit. As a testament
						to her strength, Tenka was capable of defeating a Shuuki horde alone, then fought
						against and overpowered one of the Eight Thunder Gods, Rairen almost killing him if
						Shikoku hadn't saved him.
					</p>
					<h2>Peach Blessing</h2>
					<p>
						Ame-no-Mitori (天御鳥命, Ame-no-Mitori, lit. "Heavenly Bird Life"): She is able to
						manipulate space and can teleport from one location to another. However, Tenka needs to
						touch someone else to teleport them. She can twist the space around her opponent
						ignoring all their defenses making it a sure kill move. She is capable of also
						teleporting around the battlefield 666 times without stopping.
					</p>
					<h2>Physical Abilities</h2>
					<p>
						Immense Strength: Tenka has impressive strength, being able to kick an opponent as
						strong and as massive as Rairen aside using a single attack.
					</p>
